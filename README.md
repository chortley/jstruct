jstruct is a Go CLI tool intended to making Structs from a JSON input easier. 

Often when developing an API or integrating an existing API, you have either example JSON or the API you're integrating with provides a JSON response. With jstruct, you can run the executable, input your JSON string, and get a Go struct back.
